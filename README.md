# Quest "The dates"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

This quest pays attention on the <code>Calendar</code> class in Java.

An uncomplete algorithm is given, asking to a user three <code>int</code> numbers: a day, a month and a year. 

The purpose here was to complete the algorithm for returning a full date in the "month-day-year"-format, and to find the correct corresponding day of the week.
